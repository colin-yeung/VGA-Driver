## Contributions made by Rohan Friar
- Developed state machine for reuleaux.sv by modifying Bresenham's circle algorithm from pseudocode (2 octants and points lying outside of the 3 respective centres are not plotted)
- Wrote task4.sv by intantiating fillscreen.sv, reuleaux.sv and VGA adapter, ensuring the screen is filled to black before the triangle is drawn
- Wrote rtl and syn testbenches for circle and task4 according to the algorithm given, ensuring proper functionality, especially with signed registers like crit
