## Contributions made by Rohan Friar
- Developed state machine for circle.sv by using Bresenham's circle algorithm from pseudocode
- Wrote task3.sv by intantiating fillscreen.sv, circle.sv and VGA adapter, ensuring the screen is filled to black before the circle is drawn
- Wrote rtl and syn testbenches for circle and task3 according to the algorithm given, ensuring proper functionality, especially with signed registers like crit
